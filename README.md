Restaurant App

For this submission weâ€™ve worked on 30% of the project so in the code what is expected is the user login page, 
create an account page and also a user choice page to choose either personal for ordering and business for managing and viewing orders,
its basically a an account setup app for now,
we used getx for the page navigation and We will build on the project in the coming assignments.
